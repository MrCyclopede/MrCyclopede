### hello internet

Go trough my learning javascript journey in three projects:
(actually i do python and C but Javascript is easier to show)

ðŸŒ± https://mrcyclopede.github.io/SymmetryJS/ (use up and down arrow keys to change the symetry)

ðŸŒ± https://mrcyclopede.github.io/TreeFractalJS/ (use arrow keys to make your pc slower)

ðŸŒ± https://mrcyclopede.github.io/MinecraftTetris/ (the size of your browser is the size of the game)

(Chicha online is probably my best repo)
